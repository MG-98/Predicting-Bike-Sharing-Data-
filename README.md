# Predicting Bike Sharing Data

## Introduction
This is one of [Deep learning nanodegree](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd101/parts/2e8d3b5d-aa70-4376-946f-0cdc37127d7d/modules/49d2e25d-6df2-48df-8ccd-88417ae208fc/lessons/368c9af3-c8b8-4b01-92ba-40d7e989d6e7/concepts/900d740a-e47d-4b67-be4c-ca27ea8981e2) major projects. In this project, I have built a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! By building a neural network from the ground up,  I got a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know before  moving to higher-level tools such as PyTorch or Keras.

## Dataset

The data comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset)

## Model parameter
```python
iterations = 5500
learning_rate = 0.6
hidden_nodes = 10
output_nodes = 1
```
